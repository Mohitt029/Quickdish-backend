**Quickdish Backend 🍕🚀**

Welcome to the Quickdish Backend, a Spring Boot-based API for a food delivery system. This project provides a robust backend for managing users, restaurants, orders, payments, deliveries, and more. The application supports role-based access control (RBAC) with three roles: ROLE_USER, ROLE_RESTAURANT, and ROLE_ADMIN. It uses MongoDB for persistence and integrates geospatial queries for finding nearby restaurants. Built with Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB, it offers a scalable and efficient solution for a food delivery platform.
